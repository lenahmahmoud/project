Project Idea: We are planning to build a Skin Care E-Commerce Website using React. The project will 
feature product listings, a shopping cart, secure checkout, and user-friendly navigation. It 
will also include product details, reviews, and recommendations to create an engaging and 
seamless shopping experience.

WORK PLAN:
1. Research & Analysis
Before starting the project, we researched existing e-commerce websites to understand 
their features, design patterns, and user experience. We analyzed common functions such 
as product listings, shopping carts, checkout processes, and customer reviews. This 
helped us identify the key features that should be included in our skin care e-commerce 
website and guided the design to ensure it is simple, user-friendly, and efficient.
